## 🌎 Introduction
<div align="justify">
  Recent events—particularly the aftermath of Typhoon Kristine—underline the critical importance of efficient resource allocation during times of disaster. Unprecedented catastrophes, as the term suggests, take communities by surprise, often leaving them vulnerable and unprepared to respond swiftly. In such situations, the establishment of mitigation strategies and a well-laid groundwork for disaster risk reduction and management become not just beneficial but essential for the safety and resilience of the populace. Having access to basic necessities such as clean water, gasoline, food supplies, medical kits, and other essential items in advance of a potential disaster is crucial to survival and stability. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the immediate negative impact on affected populations, enabling quicker recovery and reducing the burden on emergency response teams.
